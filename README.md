# public-website-scraper-beautifulsoup

A web scraping project using Python and BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from a public website.

This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a public website using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. It extracts structured information, processes it, and displays the results in a clean format.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features

- Scrapes tabular/text data from a target public website
- Parses and cleans data using BeautifulSoup
- Outputs extracted data into a structured format (like DataFrames)
- Easy to extend for other websites or data types

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- requests
- pandas (optional, for tabular processing)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project demonstrates how to scrape structured data from a public website using Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas.

It parses HTML content to extract information, displays the scraped results in a tabular format using a pandas DataFrame, and allows you to export the data to an Excel file using `to_excel()` with `openpyxl`.

The main notebook (`public_website_Scrapusing_BeautifulSoup.ipynb`) contains all the code required to perform the scraping, clean the data, and save it locally as `EPL Top Scorers.xlsx`. 

To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies (`pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas openpyxl`), and launch the notebook with Jupyter.
